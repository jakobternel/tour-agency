## 📌 Overview
I created this tour booking website out of a love for travel and as a goal to sharpen my front-end skills. Particularly, I wanted to improve my design skills and learn more about the implementation of microinteractions within front-end functionality. 

Additionally, I also set this project as a goal to learn the basics of Tailwind CSS as this is the first time I have used it in a full project.

I also wanted to build something fully customizable, so instead of hard-coding static pages, all content is dynamically generated from a single .json file. This approach makes the site easy to scale and maintain while keeping the structure clean and consistent.
