# üñäÔ∏è Customising The Tour Data

The data on this website is fully customisable all within a single `.json` file. You can edit background images, written content, activities, itinerary, map locations, and much more.

This file can be found in [`src/data/tourData.json/`](https://github.com/jakobternel/tour-agency/blob/master/src/data/tourData.json).

## üìÅ Basic Structure

The basic structure of the `.json` is an object with multiple elements with string index keys (e.g., "0", "1", "2").

```
{
    "0": {
        // destination 0 data here
    },
    "1": {
        // destination 1 data here
    },
    "2": {
        // destination 2 data here
    },
    ...
}
```

For each destination object, the following sections are required which are explained in more detail in the following sections.

## 1Ô∏è‚É£ Hero Section Data

The hero section is the top of the webpage as seen in the screenshot [here](https://github.com/jakobternel/tour-agency/blob/master/screenshots/hero.png).

```
{
    "0": {
        "heroContent": {
            "name": "Germany",
            "heroImageFolderRoute": "germany",
            "defaultImage": "germany_default.png",
            "heroImageNames": [
                "germany_layer1.png",
                "germany_layer2.png",
                "germany_layer3.png",
                "germany_layer4.png",
                "germany_layer5.png"
            ]
        }
        // other destination data
    }
}
```

| Field                    | Type              | Description                          |
|--------------------------|-------------------|--------------------------------------|
| `name`                   | `string`          | Name of destination       |
| `heroImageFolderRoute`   | `string`          | Subfolder holding the hero images. This must be included in the /images/ folder            |
| `defaultImage`           | `string`          | Default image to be displayed on mobile screens |
| `heroImageNames`         | `string[]`        | Array of image names for each layer of the parallax image                 |

### üí° Layering of Hero Images
Parallax hero image layers are generated dynamically based on their order in the array. The first image in the array will be the top-most image displayed (highest z-index value). Because of this, full screen parallax images should be placed last in the array.

The percentages in the array below represent the percentage of the parallax image that remains and is not transparent.

```
[ 10%, 25%, 50%, 75%, 100% ]
```

## 2Ô∏è‚É£ Bento Section Data

The bento section is the section below the hero image which contains information on the current weather, current time, itinerary, destination highlights, and tour price estimation. A screenshot of this can be seen by clicking [here](https://github.com/jakobternel/tour-agency/blob/master/screenshots/bento.png).

```

                    "content": "Arrive in Munich"
                },
                ...
            },
            "destinationSuggestions": [
                {
                    "title": "Biergarten",
                    "icon": "fi-rr-beer",
                    "description": "Munich's traditional beer gardens (Biergarten) are a major part of Bavarian life. One popular feature of these beer gardens is that you can bring your own food, as long as you buy drinks from the beer hall."
                },
                ...
            ],
            "arrAirport": "MUC",
            "destinationCoords": [48.137154, 11.576124]
        }
        // other destination data
    }
}
```

| Field                    | Type     | Description                          |
|--------------------------|----------|-------------------------------------|
| `itinerary`                   | `custom`          | [Itinerary Overview](#-itinerary-bento-component)       |
| `destinationSuggestions`   | `custom`          | [Destination Suggestions](#-destination-suggestions-content)            |
| `arrAirport`   | `string`          | Arrival airport IATA code used for flight price calculation            |
| `destinationCoords`   | `[number, number]`          | Coordinates of destination used for weather forecasting            |

### üí° Itinerary Bento Component

The itinerary bento component is able to display up to 5 day's worth of key activities at once.

If more than 5 days are entered, it will cut off the last day and display a "more" button. When clicked, this will navigate the user to the full scrollable itinerary component.

Because of this, if the tour is more than 5 days long, it is suggested to have the fifth and sixth entries left blank as follows:

```
"4": {
    "icon": "",
    "content": ""
},
"5": {
    "icon": "",
    "content": ""
}
```

| Field                    | Type     | Description                          |
|--------------------------|----------|--------------------------------------|
| `icon`                   | `string`          | Flaticon icon name       |
| `content`   | `string`          | Brief description of day            |

### üí° Itinerary & Destination Suggestions Icons

Icons for the destination suggestions can be sourced from Flaticon's library of UI icons. A list of these can be found by clicking [here](https://www.flaticon.com/uicons/interface-icons).

Please note, there is occasionally an issue with some icons not displaying. This issue does not seem to be unique to this project and I have encountered it on other projects.

### üí° Destination Suggestions Content

It is recommended to have less content in the destination suggestions section as this can be included in more depth in the full itinerary section. I recommended to limiting to a maximum of two words for the title, and around 30 words for the description.

| Field                    | Type     | Description                          |
|--------------------------|----------|--------------------------------------|
| `title`                   | `string`         | Name/title of activity       |
| `icon`   | `string`         | Flaticon icon name            |
| `description`           | `string`         | Description of activity |

### üí° Map Points

This section holds data used for the calculation and display of the tour map. The bounds of the map are automatically calculated based on the locations entered in this array.

This array can contain any number of `point` or `line` elements.

```
"mapPoints": [
    {
        "type": "point",
        "id": "munich",

        "end": [47.5576, 10.7498],
        "return": true
    }
],
```

#### Point Feature

Point features represent a single point on a map. These can be classified as a main point, or as a regular point. It is recommended to only have the start/end points of the tour as a main point for visual clarity.

#### Line Feature

Line features will display the direction of travel with an arrow placed on the line. By changing `return` to `true`, it will generate two curved lines with arrows placed on each one showing the direction of travel.
